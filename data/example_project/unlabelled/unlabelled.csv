It
rained
today
despite
what
was
said
on
the
news
.

2
You
could
see
someone
moving,
regardless
of
the
darkness

3
They
decided
to
follow
it
in
spite
of
the	
warnings
.

4
It
is
clearly
wrong
.

5
It
'
s
certainly
something
to
consider
.

6
You
could
do
it
later
,
you
know
.

7
Perhaps
there
is
a
better
way
of
doing
it
.

8
I
'
d
say
it
'
s
more
than
likely
we
will
see
him
tomorrow
.

9
The
certainty
is
quite
low
.

10
They
appeared
happy
about
it
.

11
We
'
ll
maybe
be
there
a
bit
earlier
tomorrow
.

12
The
probability
is
unknown
.

13
Quite
hard
to
believe
.

14
Try
to
see
it
my
way
!

15
it
'
s
not
completely
certain
.

16
yesterday
by
contrast
it
all
went
fine
.

17
he
said
he
was
allergic,
nonetheless
he
did
eat
it
.

18
I
don
'
t
think
.

19
I
don
'
t
believe
.

19
I
couln
'
t
believe
you
.
