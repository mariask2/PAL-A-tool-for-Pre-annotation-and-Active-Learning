# PAL: A tool for Pre-annotation and Active Learning

The aim of “PAL, a tool for Pre-annotation and Active Learning” is to provide a ready-made package that can be used to simplify annotation and to reduce the amount of annotated data required to train a machine learning classifier. The package provides support for two techniques that have been shown to be successful in previous studies, namely active learning and pre-annotation.

 See the readme.pdf file for information on how to configure and run the package, as well as on how to install the packages on which PAL depends.
