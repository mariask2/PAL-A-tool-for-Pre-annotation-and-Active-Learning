# PAL: A tool for Pre-annotation and Active Learning

The aim of “PAL, a tool for Pre-annotation and Active Learning” is to provide a ready-made package that can be used to simplify annotation and to reduce the amount of annotated data required to train a machine learning classifier. The package provides support for two techniques that have been shown to be successful in previous studies, namely active learning and pre-annotation.

Documentation on the motivation for the creating PAL and pointers to research within pre-annotation and active learning will be available soon. See the readme.pdf file for information on how to configure and run the package, as well as on how to install the packages on which PAL depends.
