# PAL: A tool for Pre-annotation and Active Learning

This package contains functionality for applying three techniques for reducing the amount of annotated data required for training a machine learning classifier and for simplifying the annotation process:
i) incorporation of information from unsupervised approaches.
ii) the selection of training samples that are informative to the classifier by the use of active learning.
iii) pre-annotation of data.

More documentation will be available soon. Documentation on how to use the package, motivations for choices made as well as commented code.
